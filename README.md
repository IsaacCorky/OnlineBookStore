    Assignment #8
    Continuing the Bookstore project from Assignments #5-7, add the ability for the user to 
    add books to their shopping cart.  The cart should update the quantity, price, subtotal, 
    and total for each book that is added.  The information should stay in the cart as long 
    as the app is running.Include the functionality for the user to “Continue Shopping” and 
    go back to the page where they left off when they added the item to their cart.Also add 
    the functionality to the app to:•Remove items from the cart•Display the cart summary on 
    the navbar so that it is displayed on each page(#notcoveredinthevideos, but Ch. 9 in 
    the Freeman textbook will be a great resource)Make sure to:•Use a Razor page forthe 
    Shopping Cart.
    •Use a SQLite database.  (Convert from SQLServer if necessary.) 
    As always, write clean code that is easy to read.
